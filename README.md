<b>Technologies & Tools Utilized:</b> React, Node, MongoDB, Express, Mongoose, Socket.io, React Query, HTML & CSS.</b> This project was inspired directly from popular platforms such as Facebook and iMessage, I decided to construct my own version of the software that everday people use to connect with others around the world daily. 
- To begin, I initially structured my application using the MVC software architectural pattern. Doing this will allow better modularity across the source code, an easier time with debugging, and a lot of other benefits of keeping the project organized as things scale in the future.
- For my choice of backend technologies I went with Node because of its V8 engine that interprets code, its event driven architecture along with my familiarity with using JavaScript in the front end. I could continue using the same language.
- Through the means of levarging powerful technologies such as web sockets provided by socket.io
